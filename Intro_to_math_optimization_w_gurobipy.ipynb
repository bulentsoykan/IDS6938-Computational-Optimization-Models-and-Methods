Assume that only one candidate can be assigned to a job, and at most one job can be assigned to a candidate.\n",

Consequently, the Gurobi Optimizer must choose two resources to fill the jobs demand, leave one job unfilled, and maximize the total matching scores. Notice that the two top matching scores are 80% (Joe for the Tester job) and 73% (Monika for the Java Developer job). Also, notice that the lowest score is 13% (Carlos for the Architect job). Assigning Joe to the Tester job, Monika to the Java Developer job, and nobody to the Architect job costs $\\$5,000$  and yields a total matching score of 153.
